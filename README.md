# Hello Stranger!

If you're on this page, you probably want to find out more about my contributions in this project as a Tester and how the whole process looked. I will explain everything in a few short lines here:

Firstly, our school, the **London School Of Emerging Technologies (LSET)**, prepared an online banking app for us (testers). There were 3 testers, including myself. This app needed a lot of testing.

We worked using **Agile Scrum**. So, we started by planning and adding user stories onto Jira (we worked on [atlassian.net](https://www.atlassian.net)).

In our team, we had:
- 3 Testers - responsible for testing the entire app.
- 2 DevOps - working on integrating everything to ensure it functioned well.
- 1 Front-End Developer - tasked with fixing the bugs we reported on Jira as the project progressed.
- 1 Project Manager - managing the entire project and addressing all issues.

To clarify, all of us (the whole team) were learning. Occasionally, our teachers would join the calls to monitor our progress and offer guidance.

Once all the stories were ready and in the backlog, we created our first sprint and started the project by writing all the test documents, including:
- Test Plan
- Test Strategy
- Test Risk Management
- Test Cases

You can find them here: [Test Documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VPrYV-K0rIFvv37PQZCjflE1e2OcZtGI?usp=sharing)

Disclaimer: If you see strange emails in test cases, these were accounts created on 10-minute email websites (just so we didn't have to provide our real ones).

Once all the documents were ready (including test cases), we started testing the web app manually. This process took a lot of time because we encountered some issues (for example, the website didn't work for over a week because the DevOps team couldn't deploy the front end, so we had to wait, similar to a real company). However, we finally managed to finish and started writing automated tests in Selenium. Overall, we found around 53 bugs by doing manual tests.

Just because I wanted to demonstrate my capabilities, I wrote all the tests on my own for this portfolio and my knowledge, but in reality, the contribution was split equally among the team.

You can find my Selenium tests here: [My Tests](https://github.com/Lisorek/LSET-Banking-App-Project/tree/main/src/main/java)  (To run them in your inteliJ, you'll need latest Selenium libraries added to the project)

Then while still waiting for my team to finish their part in selenium testing, I thought I will start writing Test cases for API tests, you can still find them here: [Test Cases API](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S8K-cnSpvLZutXFtXi6KGaPK8EknD1e_wborZwLQheA/edit#gid=0)

Also while I was writing test cases, I thought I will also do some of the testing too, you can find my postman tests here: [Postman Tests](https://github.com/Lisorek/LSET-Banking-App-Project-API-Tests)

After I finished my API tests I decided to start writing a Final Report here: [Final Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SlQpZq414b7TDqNktnG0uCr9-j0BffjyITiMTY0aavI/) to close the project.
